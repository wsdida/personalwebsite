I am a developer passionate about building efficient and scalable systems. In the field of Artificial Intelligence, I focus on bridging the gap between algorithmic models and production environments. My current work centers on LLMOps, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and high-performance distributed systems. I firmly believe that elegant code and robust architecture are the cornerstones of delivering real value through AI.
