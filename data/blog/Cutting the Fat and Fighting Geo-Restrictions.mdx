## Background
My initial roadmap was overly ambitious: a cross-platform distribution engine for every major social network. As a first-time founder, I fell into the "feature trap."
## The Challenge
Scope Creep: The project was too broad for a solo dev.
Financial Barriers: Lack of access to Stripe/PayPal in my region created a massive roadblock for the subscription model.
##  The Process
- Strategy: Consulted with ChatGPT to validate a leaner MVP. We narrowed the focus to AI-driven Title and CTA optimization.
- Tech Stack: Deployed the blog, integrated OpenCode frameworks for the initial UI.
- Infrastructure: Conducted a teardown of Paddle vs. Kit. Selected Paddle for its Merchant of Record (MoR) model which bypasses my local payment hurdles.
##  Next Steps
Testing the OpenCode framework and initiating the Paddle verification process.
