# The Context:
As the product evolves, the original layout for the generation page felt cluttered. Moreover, the AI’s JSON responses were occasionally inconsistent, causing frontend crashes.
# The Challenge:
Redesigning the workflow without breaking the existing core logic while ensuring the production environment is secure and scalable.
# The Solution:
Layout Refactor: Implemented a more intuitive flow with better visual feedback during the "loading" states.
Data Mapping: Added a robust validation layer between the AI API and the UI to handle non-structured data gracefully.
Server Config: Configured the production environment with proper SSL, firewall rules, and automated deployment scripts.
# Results:
The app is significantly more stable, and the generation quality has improved by roughly 30% thanks to refined prompt engineering.
# What’s Next:
Preparing for a closed beta to gather initial user feedback.
